            <ol>

                <li>By default the migration is scheduled to run immediately. To schedule the migration at a different date and time, uncheck the "Immediately" checkbox and select the data and time.</li>

                <li>Click on Ok. Depending on the number of objects and the size of objects, the Migration will be started at scheduled time (or immediately).</li>
                <li>You can check the migration details under the Dataflow page. In the table, expand to view the details of the migration task.</li>
                <li>You can see the source, the destination, the total size of the objects to be migrated, the size of objects currently migrated and the progress of the migration.</li>
